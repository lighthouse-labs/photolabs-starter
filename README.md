Photolabs is a simple single page application where you can view photos, click them to view in modal mode with similar photos listed below, and click the :heart: heart button to favourite photos!

![Opening a photos modal](https://github.com/lunamoonmoon/photolabs/blob/main/docs/modal.png?raw=true)
Here you can see the selected photo in modal mode, notice the homepage in the background with a slight tint to keep the users focus on the open modal.

There are quite a few photos on our homepage!
